/**
 * The upload decision, lifted out of ContractAnalyzer so it can be tested.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT CHANGES NO BEHAVIOUR
 *
 * The validation on bob/pdf-extraction is good: unsupported type, size limit,
 * %PDF- magic bytes, scanned/image-only detection, password-protected, corrupt.
 * All of it correct, and both fabricated-text blocks are gone.
 *
 * But it lives inline in an async handler that also touches six pieces of React
 * state, so none of it can be exercised without a DOM. This file is the same
 * rules as pure functions. Same thresholds, same messages, same order. The
 * component calls these instead of inlining them, and the suite in
 * uploadDecision.test.ts can then prove the refusals actually refuse.
 *
 * Roles (4 Oct): Terrance owns extraction and validation; James owns states and
 * verification. This does not touch the extractor. It makes the decisions he
 * already wrote checkable, which is the half I was asked for.

/**
 * THE SERVER ALREADY TELLS THE TRUTH. THE CLIENT THROWS IT AWAY.
 *
 * `server.ts` reads GEMINI_API_KEY and, when it is missing, returns a complete
 * analysis it made up: riskScore 72, named red flags about Grant of Rights and
 * Cross-Collateralization, explanations, questions to ask. It is honest about
 * doing so — it sets `fallback: true` and writes "AI key not set on
 * environment" into the summary.
 *
 * `ContractAnalyzer` does `const result: ContractAnalysis = await
 * response.json(); setAnalysis(result)`. One grep for "fallback" across src/
 * finds the word only inside an unrelated formatCurrency warning. The flag is
 * discarded, and an artist who uploads a 360 deal is shown a risk score for a
 * document that nothing read.
 *
 * There is no .env in this checkout, so that is every analysis the app performs
 * today. Found by IBM Bob on 2026-10-06 and verified by opening the lines; see
 * docs/BOB_SESSION_2026-10-06_HONESTY_AUDIT.md.
 *
 * This is the same disease as the fabricated contract text and the sample
 * analysis under a refusal: something on screen that the system has not
 * established about THIS document. The cure is the same. Refuse, and say why.
